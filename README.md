# Insights-into-Global-Energy-Trends
## Problem Statement: 
The primary challenge addressed in this project is the accurate prediction and analysis of sustainable energy indicators to support data-driven decision-making and policy formulation.

## Key objectives include: 
1.	Classifying Countries with a potential for building the energy infrastructure on renewable energy. 
2.	Predicting future electricity consumption patterns to aid in planning and resource allocation.
3.	Forecasting carbon emissions to support climate change mitigation strategies.

## Methodology:
1.	Feed Forward Neural Network: FNN is used to analyze past electricity consumption sequences and predict future values, capturing temporal dependencies and trends.
2.	ARIMA Model: ARIMA models account for overall trends in the data, providing forecasts for various energy indicators.
3.	Smoothing Methods: Techniques such as moving averages and exponential smoothing applied to identify long-term trends and reduce noise in the dataset, facilitating clearer insights into energy consumption patterns
